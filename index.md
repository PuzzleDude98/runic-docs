# Welcome to the Runics documentation!

Runics is a minecraft magic mod based around JSON structures. The mod is currently in its infancy, so features are limited. To get started, check out [How to Use](guides/using.md) or [Rune Types](types/rune_types.md)!

Untested features are listed [here](testing_needed.md).
